# Polish-Fighter-Game
Project Description
The Polish Fighter is a game written in C# using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). The main idea of the game is to create your own character, train them, and participate in battles against various opponents in different locations. The player can develop their character, improve their stats, and unlock new challenges.

Features

1. Character Creation:
Players can create a new character by selecting their stats.
Once confirmed, the stats are saved in the data.txt file, allowing for continued play with the same character in future sessions.

2.Main Game Window:
The main window offers options to start a new game or continue an existing one.
Selecting "New Game" opens the character creation window.
Selecting "Continue Game" loads the existing character with the stats saved from previous sessions.

3.Character Training:
Players can train their character to improve their stats.
The training affects different attributes, depending on the type of exercise performed.

4.In-Game Time Progression:
The current in-game date is displayed at the top of the screen.
Players can skip to the next day, which improves the characterâ€™s stats based on the training completed.

5.Character Statistics:
A detailed view of the character's stats is available at any time, showing current strength, agility, endurance, and other key attributes.

6.Battle System:
Players can engage in battles with 1 of 4 opponents. Defeating all the opponents unlocks new locations for further battles.
The battle system allows players to challenge themselves by setting new records, especially in running competitions.
